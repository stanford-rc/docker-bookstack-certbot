Hello!  This is a container image based on the
[LinuxServer.io](https://linuxserver.io) [Bookstack
container](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-bookstack).  It has been
modified to include Certbot.

With this image, you can have a Bookstack installation that automatically keeps
its server certificate up-to-date.  Data (certs and logs) are kept in the
`/config` path you already use.

## Usage

To use this container, you should follow the [Bookstack Usage
instructions](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-bookstack#usage), but
with the following changes:

### Container Image

You should pull your container image from here, instead of from Bookstack

### Variables

When you launch your Bookstack container, you will need to include two
additional environment variables:

* `LETS_ENCRYPT_CONTACT`: This must be set to an email address.  This email
  address will be sent important notifications from Let's Encrypt.  For
  example, in 2022 Let's Encrypt revoked a number of certificates; the
  certificates were revoked [after only a 5-day
  notice](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/2022-01-25-issue-with-tls-alpn-01-validation-method/170450).
  In instances like that, Let's Encrypt will use this email address to notify
  you.

* `LETS_ENCRYPT_TOS_AGREE`: This must be set to the string `yes`.  Setting this
  to `yes` indicates that you accept the [Let's Encrypt Terms of
  Service](https://community.letsencrypt.org/tos).

Also, the following existing variables have changed:

* `APP_URL`: This **must** be an HTTPS URL.  Also, forward-slashes are not
  allowed (though port numbers are allowed).  In other words, your URL must
  point to the root of a domain.

  For example, `https://example.com` and `https://example.com:8080` are valid;
  but `https://example.com/`, `https://example.com:8080/`,
  `https://example.com/app`, and `https://example.com:8080/app` are not
  allowed.

## Config Changes

With this container, several new things appear in your `/config` directory:

* **Let's Encrypt Logs**: In `/config/logs/letsencrypt`, you will find
  Certbot's logs.  These will be log-rotated automatically.

* **TBD**: In `/config/TBD`, you will find the TLS private key and certificate
  chain for your site.  **Do not mess with these!**
